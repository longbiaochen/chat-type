# ChatType Visual Acceptance

Use this chain for ChatType HUD or interaction-facing visual work after unit/integration tests pass.

## Required Command

```sh
./scripts/visual_acceptance.sh --install
```

The command packages the current build, installs it to `/Applications/ChatType.app`, launches one installed-app demo process per HUD state through LaunchServices with `CHATTYPE_OVERLAY_DEMO=1` and `--overlay-demo-state`, discovers the ChatType HUD window with CoreGraphics, captures that window with `screencapture -l`, and runs the screenshot verifier.

The script intentionally stops each transient overlay-demo process between HUD states. That cleanup is not the final user-review state. A successful run must relaunch the normal installed app from `/Applications/ChatType.app`, verify that ChatType is running, and leave it running.

## Evidence

Each run writes a timestamped directory under:

```text
dist/visual-acceptance/<run-id>
```

The directory must contain HUD-window screenshots:

- `01-recording.png`
- `02-processing.png`
- `03-result.png`
- `04-error.png`
- `05-retryable-error.png`
- `verification.txt`
- `summary.md`

## Closeout Rule

For ChatType UI closeouts, report:

- the visual acceptance artifact directory
- whether `verification.txt` passed
- the installed-app live flow used for interaction acceptance
- the observed paste-versus-clipboard result when transcription/injection behavior was touched
- the normal installed ChatType runtime state left for user review

The scripted visual run does not replace Computer Use interaction acceptance. It proves the installed build can render the expected HUD states and retry affordance without relying on full-screen screenshots, foreground browser state, or guessed screen bands. Do not finish a ChatType GUI closeout by quitting or killing the app; if a script performs internal demo cleanup, relaunch `/Applications/ChatType.app` before reporting completion.
